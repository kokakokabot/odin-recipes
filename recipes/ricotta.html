    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This creamy, rich ricotta is a revelation when eaten warm, fresh from the pot. While store-bought is great in a
        pinch, this stuff certainly has it beat. Below, a few important things to know before you start on your ricotta
        journey.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 3/4 c. whole milk</li>
        <li>1/4 c. heavy cream</li>
        <li>Pinch kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. plus 2 tsp white vinegar (or lemon juice)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine milk, cream, and salt in a medium pot over medium heat. Heat milk until a thermometer reads 185°.
        </li>
        <li>Add vinegar or lemon juice and stir to incorporate—curds should begin forming immediately. Reduce heat to
            lowest setting and leave mixture undisturbed for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Fit a strainer into a large bowl and line with a single layer of water-dampened cheesecloth. Use a slotted
            spoon to transfer curds into strainer and let stand until most liquid has strained into bowl, 3 to 4
            minutes. Transfer to an airtight container and keep for up to 2 weeks.</li>
    </ol>
